{"title":"Song","author":"John Clare","lines":["I would not feign a single sigh","  Nor weep a single tear for thee:","The soul within these orbs burns dry;","  A desert spreads where love should be.","I would not be a worm to crawl","  A writhing suppliant in thy way;","For love is life, is heaven, and all","  The beams of an immortal day.","","For sighs are idle things and vain,","  And tears for idiots vainly fall.","I would not kiss thy face again","  Nor round thy shining slippers crawl.","Love is the honey, not the bee,","  Nor would I turn its sweets to gall","For all the beauty found in thee,","  Thy lily neck, rose cheek, and all.","","I would not feign a single tale","  Thy kindness or thy love to seek;","Nor sigh for Jenny of the Vale,","  Her ruby smile or rosy cheek.","I would not have a pain to own","  For those dark curls and those bright eyes","A frowning lip, a heart of stone,","  False love and folly I despise."],"linecount":"24"}
